# Dolly-2.0-LLM

Databricksâ€™ dolly-v2-12b, an instruction-following large language model trained on the Databricks machine learning platform that is licensed for commercial use. 
Based on pythia-12b, Dolly is trained on ~15k instruction/response fine tuning records databricks-dolly-15k generated by Databricks employees in capability domains from the InstructGPT paper, 
including brainstorming, classification, closed QA, generation, information extraction, open QA and summarization. 
dolly-v2-12b is not a state-of-the-art model, but does exhibit surprisingly high quality instruction following behavior not characteristic of the foundation model on which it is based.
